# MONARK

Monark is a graphical interface for sending either groupbased- or single recipient SMS messages.
To be able to use MONARK you will have to obtain an API-KEY from  smsit.dk, though we are ready to expand with other carriers.

Features:

  - Send single or groupbased sms-messages.
  - Choose a sendername, which will show at the recipients cellphone.
  - Use a *.CSV file with a list of recipients to send an SMS to everyone in the list.

The *.CSV-file has no line seperators, but each line is a phonenumber. 
At the moment only Danish (+45) numbers are valid, which means no 45 or +45 should be in front of the number.

Your licensekey is of type *.MAPI, and should contaitn your API-key from the carrier. This should be loaded by choosing File-> Load API-KEY.




**Free Software, Hell Yeah!**
